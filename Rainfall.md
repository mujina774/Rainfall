## About this dataset

Water is essential to our planet and is a key component for transporting heat throughout the ocean and atmosphere. Fresh water also is vital for supporting life. Precipitation as a source of fresh water links Earth’s water and energy cycles. Thus, knowing when, where, and how precipitation falls is of paramount importance for science and society.

Earth-observing satellites offer the most efficient, cost-effective means of gathering global precipitation data. Building upon the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; operational 1997 to 2015), the GPM Core Observatory launched in 2014 as a collaboration between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

GPM comprises a consortium of international space agencies that provide next-generation global observations of rain and snow. The GPM concept centers on the deployment of a “Core Observatory” satellite carrying an advanced radar/radiometer system to measure precipitation from space and serve as a reference standard to unify precipitation measurements from a constellation of research and operational satellites.

Specially, the GPM Core Observatory design is an extension of TRMM’s highly successful rain-sensing package, which focused on heavy to moderate tropical and subtropical rain between approximately 35° north and south of the equator. Since light rain and falling snow account for significant fractions of precipitation in middle and high latitudes, a key advancement of GPM over TRMM is the extended capability to measure light rain (< 0.5 mm/hour), solid precipitation (e.g., snow), and the microphysical properties of precipitating particles between approximately 65° north and south latitude. This capability drives the designs of GPM’s active (e.g., radar) and passive microwave (e.g., radiometer) instruments. The GPM Core Observatory acts as a reference standard for the precipitation estimates acquired by sensors aboard the GPM constellation of satellites.

NASA’s TRMM and GPM missions have amassed a precipitation data record spanning almost a quarter-century. Starting in 2019, data from both TRMM and GPM were available as a unified dataset called the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG). The IMERG algorithm combines information from the constellation of satellites to estimate precipitation over the majority of Earth's surface and fuses the TRMM precipitation estimates collected in 2000-2014 with GPM precipitation estimates. By being able to compare and contrast past and present data, researchers can create more accurate climate and weather models, gain a better understanding of normal and extreme rain and snowfall, and strengthen applications for current and future disasters, disease monitoring, resource management, energy production, and food security.

The maps above show the most currently available precipitation data from IMERG and depict how rain and snow move around the planet. The IMERG dataset covers more of the globe than any previous precipitation dataset and is updated every half hour, allowing researchers to know where and how much precipitation falls—in millimeters—around the world at a given time. As scientists work to understand all the elements of Earth's climate and weather systems, and how these are changing, GPM provides a major step forward in providing the scientific community comprehensive and consistent measurements of precipitation.
